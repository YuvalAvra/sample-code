We have an official Jenkins plugin for Prisma Cloud Compute. You can find examples of its usage in our [documentation](https://docs.twistlock.com/docs/compute_edition/continuous_integration/jenkins_plugin.html).

If there are any use cases not covered in the documentation that are important to you and you feel should be represented, feel free to open an issue or pull request in either [this repository](https://github.com/twistlock/sample-code) or our [docs repository](https://github.com/twistlock/docs).
